Hi, I’m @TechnologyPlus. I have a YouTube channel about computing (stuff like testing programs, malware, operative systems...). Remember the next time you enter YT subscribe to me (this will help me get motivated to create new content). And also to follow me on Twitter (now renamed by Elon Musk to '𝕏'. Yes, I also think that's pathetic).
